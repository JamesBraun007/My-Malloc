## Description:
MyMalloc is a custom implementation of the standard malloc() function found in the C standard library. It support dynamic memory allocation and deallocation, and is capable of splitting and coalescing memory in constant time due to the usage of a segregated free list data structure. 


## Build Instructions:
After downloading the files in this repository to your personal computer, the project can be built by compiling all of the source code files in one simple step by using the included Makefile. In order to build the project properly, all of the files (including the Makefile) must be within the same directory.
The git commands are included for my academic github, but can be omitted for other users. 


## Run Instructions: 
Once the project is built, the user can utilize MyShell as a bash clone by typing 'shell' in the terminal. Any operation that can be performed on the original bash can be performed with MyShell, including IO redirection, subshells, and more. There is also support for shell scripts that include while loops, for loops, 
if-statements, environment variables, etc.
